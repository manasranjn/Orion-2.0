## Types of Components
- There are 2 types of components in react.
  1. Class Based Component
  2. Functional Component or Function Based Component

# Difference between Class Component and Functional Component
- Class Component :-
  - Use class keyword and class name
  - Statefull
  - It has no Hooks
  - It has lifecycle methods
  - It use render() method
  - Syntax:
    import React from "react";
    import { Component } from "react";

class ClassComponentName extends Component {
render() {
return (

<div>
<h1>Class Component</h1>
</div>
);
}
}
export default ClassComponent;

- Functional Component :-
  - Use function keyword and function name
  - Stateless
  - It has Hooks
  - It doesn't have lifecycle methods
  - It doesn't use render() method
  - Syntax:
    import React from "react";
    const Navbar = () => {
    return (
    <div>
    <h1>Navbar</h1>
    </div>
    );
    };

export default Navbar;

# Props
- Props are inbuilt features of react.
- Props are used to pass data from parent to child component.
- Props are immutable, it means once the value is passed from parent component, it can't be changed.
- Props are uni-directional.

e.g :-
- Write a program to send a string data as props.
  App.jsx :
  import React from "react";
  import Content from "./Components/Content";

const App = () => {
return (

<div>
<Content name="Rahul" />
</div>
);
};

export default App;

Content.jsx :
import React from "react";
const Content = (props) => {
return (

<div>
<h1>{props.name}</h1>
</div>
);
};
export default Content;

- Write a program to send an array as props.
  App.jsx :
  import React from "react";
  import Content from "./Components/Content";

const App = () => {
return (

<div>
<Content mark={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]} />
</div>
)
};

export default App;

Content.jsx :
import React from "react";
const Content = ({mark}) => {
return (

<div>
<h1>
      Mark: 
        {mark.map((item) => (
          <p>{item}</p>
        ))}
      </h1>
</div>
);
};
export default Content;

- Write a program to send an object as props.
  App.jsx :
  import React from "react";
  import Content from "./Components/Content";

const App = () => {
return (

<div>
<Content name={{ firstName: "Rahul", lastName: "Gupta" }} />
</div>
);
};

export default App;

Content.jsx :
import React from "react";
const Content = (props) => {
return (

<div>
<h1>{props.name.firstName}</h1>
<h1>{props.name.lastName}</h1>
</div>
);
};
export default Content;
